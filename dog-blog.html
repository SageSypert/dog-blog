  <p>Cairo is an old lab mix that came from Southern California in 2013. He started as a foster and was quickly adopted due to his sweet, laid-back nature. </p>

  <p>Here are some of Cairo's favorite things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Squirrels</li>
    <li>Naps</li>
    <li>The sound of a bag of shredded cheese opening</li>
    <li>Car rides</li>
    <li>Cats</li>
  </ul>
